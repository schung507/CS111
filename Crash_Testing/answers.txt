For our design problem, we implemented an ioctl that introduced the 
variable nwrites_to_crash. nwrites_to_crash determines when the system
crashes: if it is a positive integer or -1, the file system acts normally, 
and if it is 0, the file system behaves as if it is executing all commands,
but it is actually silently failing. We declare the ioctl in ospfs.h and
implement it in ospfsmod.c (nwrites_to_crash is checked and decremented in
ospfs_write, ospfs_create, ospfs_link, symlink, and unlink. set_crash is
the user space where the ioctl sets the value of nwrites_to_crash. Our
tester, crash-tester.sh, shows the incorrect state of the file system after
it crashes. (Some issues with the bash script, but running the code on QEMU,
all the crashes with the various functions work as intended.)
