Known problems with the code: Some of the tests that are reliant on timing do not 
pass on the first trial because the processes are not coming out in the correct order.
We assume this is because the CPU we are testing on is skewing the times for the sleeps
and waits in certain tests in the test script because the CPU is so slow (e.g. QEMU takes 
about 5 minutes to start). In addition, it seems that sometimes when the process is 
interrupted it does not return -ERESTARTSYS or at least does not go into the if handler
for those returns, thus causing the tests that check for interrupts to sometimes fail.
