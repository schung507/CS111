This is a skeleton for CS 111 Lab 1.

Partner: Lynn Hao Tran

Limitations:
-Our parser can't handle sequence commands sometimes when it contains parantheses
-Prints out undefined garbage sometimes because it accesses null pointer somewhere
-in execution, command hangs sometimes when it handles large files

UPDATE
-all test cases should work
-if test case does not work, problem should be coming from parser.c
