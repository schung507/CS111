# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)
We implemented forking in order to make peer downloads and upload files
in parallel. By forking, there are multiple child processes at once that are
downloading and uploading whatever files are requested and then exit.

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

- In start_download, we change an unsafe strcpy() to strncpy(). Previously,
a peer could give us a bad file name that overran the size of the file
name buffer, therby making it possible to corrupt nearby data. With strncpy(),
we prevent this because strncpy() allows you to set the size to be copied. In
our case, we copy only up to FILENAMESIZ.

- Similarly, we change an unsafe strcpy() to strncpy() in task_download
in order to check the file names being given by another peer. We only check
peers because we assume that the tracker is always safe, but peers can
potentially attempt to exploit an unprotected buffer. Again, we only allow
FILENAMESIZ bytes to be copied.

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

- Increase the size of the task buffer by a factor of four
The size of the task buffer given in the skeleton was not able to handle
the traffic from make-popular. There were too many peers who would be
able to serve the file but not enough space to hold the aliases of the
peers in the buffer. To combat this, we increase the capacity of the buffer
so that it is not saturated by the influx of peers and we can thus download
files in make-popular.

- Buffer Overruns
We fix buffer overruns in the places specified in 2A using the safe version
of strcpy(), strncpy(), where you can specify the number of bytes that will
be copied into the string. Another defensive measure added on is making the
last position in the string a null byte so that we will always have a null-
terminated string.

- Only serving files in the current directory and subdirectories underneath
We do not want peers to try to be able to access other directories; access
is restricted to the current directory and subdirectories in task_upload. We
see what the file path is being requested and compare the beginning of the
file path name to current directory; if they match the file is contained in
that directory (even if it's in another subdirectory. We use strncompare() to
look for only the length of the current directory string.

- Upload requests with within bounds file names
Previously, a peer could request a file that was larger than FILENAMESIZ, but
we check that the requested file name is within bounds of the buffer, otherwise
we do not initialize the upload.

- Zero out buffers for file names and disk file names
When we create a new task or pop a peer, the file name and disk file name's
first byte is set to NULL so that it appears to be empty, but it does not get
rid of any other bytes in the string, leaving potential garbage that can be accessed.
To prevent this situation, we use strncpy to copy FILENAMESIZ number of NULL bytes
into the buffer.

- Time out slow peers
In order to prevent slow peers, we set a threshold in task_download that checks as we
read the file into the task buffer. We collect SAMPLES (10) amount of samples to and
average them to find the average speed of download. If it does not meet the threshold,
then the peer is deemed too slow.

-Time out overly large files
Using the same mechanism in task_download, we set a variable that sets the maximum size
of a file, which we choose as 1MB. After each read from the task buffer, a running amount
of bytes downloaded is incremented; if the number of bytes ever exceeds the maximum size,
we return with error saying that the file is too large.

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

1. Buffer overflow - We requested a file with a filename of length FILENAMESIZ*5. Overflowing 
the filename can corrupt memory and cause segfaults. In more extreme cases, buffer overflow can
also potentially insert malicious code into a program to be executed. This attack is similar to
the next one in that the client requests a file that the server is not serving.

2. Request bad file - We requested a file not in the directory ( "../source.c"). 
When you get a request you assume your client wants to download a file you're serving but since 
the protocol doesn't require that, they can request any file they want. This is an attack by 
using the software in way not originally intended. 

3. DoS attack - For evil_mode 3, we repeatedly requested t->filename in a while loop. When 
you're downloading, you're assuming the other peer is actively uploading something so you're 
dedicating some resources to it. However, they can say they're uploading and do nothing. 
Here, we are repeatedly requesting without uploading which is using up resources and making 
the client less available to other peers.

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
Evil_mode 1 (buffer overflow) is implemented but causes glibc errors. Other 2 attacks work.
